# Advanced usage
The first and foremost aim of this server implementation is to help players play the game. Therefore, if you have trouble with that part, you can reach out through various community channels to ask for help. However, advanced usage of the server / tools that come along with the server can be very difficult. As we cannot commit to helping everyone who want advanced usage, the following are expected if you want to do anything we consider advanced usage:

- You are expected to know about computer:
  - You should know how to use common shell utilities.
- You are expected to know about online video games:
  - You should know what is a server, what is a client, what is a connection.
- If you asked for help, you should only expect help in the form of hard-to-get information or pointers:
  - Hard-to-get information is anything that will take a long time to figure out on your own (i.e. where a functionaility is implemented or the specific behaviour of some system).
  - Pointers are topics that you should know about first before doing something advanced. Once you are given pointers, you are expected to study them yourself using the Internet (blogs, wiki, video essays, llm, ...).
- If you asked for help and get pointed to a documentation page/section, you are expected to read that page/section, and point out where you didn't understand or where the tool failed, etc.

Throughout this repository, you will find this page referenced whenever an advanced topic is discussed:

- Any topic that is discussed this repository but do not reference this page is NOT considered advanced.
- Any topic that is discussed this repository and reference this page is considered to the EXPLICITLY ADVANCED.
- Any topic that is NOT DISCUSSED in this repository is considered IMPLICITLY ADVANCED:

    - You you can ask for help but the amount of help you get will depend on whether people are interested in helping you or not.
- Usually, the reference will also include a short list of things you should know to make sure you can do it.

tl; dr: if you want to do anything harder than playing the game + using the basic webui features, expect to study and do most of the work yourself.
